#### Flask Scrapper

Run the following commands for `python-3` on `unix` based systems (I am using `venv` as well),

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install python3-pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    export FLASK_APP=app.py
    flask run
You should see a server running here, `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`
